These are globals that are known to not have side-effects when the property is accessed. For example, accessing the global <code>Array</code> property is considered to be side-effect free but accessing the global <code>scrollY</code> property can trigger a layout, which is a side-effect. This is used by esbuild's tree-shaking to safely remove unused code that is known to be side-effect free.

Furthermore it has already been implemented by <a href=\"https://docs.deno.com/examples/importing_bytes/\">Deno</a> and <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/19928\">Webpack</a>.

gradient headers, zebra striping, hover effects, and responsive design\r\n- Integrated extension into demo worker.js for local testing\r\n- Updated demo index.html to include table styles\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n- Gradient blue header background with white bold text\r\n- Zebra striping for alternating row colors\r\n- Hover effects on table rows\r\n- Rounded borders and shadows\r\n- Responsive

Emphasis was processed before codespans (violates CommonMark precedence)\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n- [x] Updated `blockSkip` regex to handle multiple backticks (same pattern as `inlineCode`)\r\n- [x] Changed tokenization order: codespans before emphasis\r\n- [x] Added comprehensive unit tests\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n```typescript\r\n// src/rules.ts - Updated blockSkip regex\r\n(`+)([^`]|[^`][\\s\\S]*?[^`])\\1(?!`)\r\n\r\n// src/Lexer.ts - Fixed tokenization order  \r\nif (token = this.tokenizer.codespan(src)) { /* process first */ }\r\nif (token = this.tokenizer.emStrong(src, maskedSrc, prevChar)) { /* process after */ }\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Contributor\r\n\r\n- [x] Test(s) exist to ensure functionality and minimize regression - Added `test/unit/issue-3776-backtick-precedence.test.js` with 6 comprehensive test cases covering:\r\n  - Double backticks (main issue case)\r\n  - Quadruple backticks\r\n  - Single & triple backticks (regression tests)  \r\n  - Mixed emphasis and codespan scenarios\r\n  - Nested cases\r\n- [x] Full test suite passes (1705/1705 tests)\r\n\r\n## Committer\r\n\r\n- [ ] CI is green (no forced merge required).\r\n- [ ] Squash and Merge PR following [conventional commit guidelines](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).", "created_at": "2025-10-05T06:03:01Z", "updated_at": "2025-10-17T07:05:04Z", "closed_at": "2025-10-17T07:05:04Z", "merged_at": "2025-10-17T07:05:04Z", "merge_commit_sha": "1da8fb5da93f9623ce975369a1d4e67eee4d8ba8", "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "requested_reviewers": [{"login": "calculuschild", "id": 5878534, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU4Nzg1MzQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5878534?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/calculuschild", "html_url": "https://github.com/calculuschild", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/calculuschild/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/calculuschild/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/calculuschild/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/calculuschild/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/calculuschild/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/calculuschild/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/calculuschild/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/calculuschild/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/calculuschild/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [{"id": 3428507766, "node_id": "LA_kwDOAB_9w87MWuB2", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/markedjs/marked/labels/hacktoberfest-accepted", "name": "hacktoberfest-accepted", "color": "A06706", "default": false, "description": ""}], "milestone": null, "draft": false, "commits_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/markedjs/marked/pulls/3786/commits", "review_comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/markedjs/marked/pulls/3786/comments", "review_comment_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/markedjs/marked/pulls/comments{/number}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/markedjs/marked/issues/3786/comments", "statuses_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/markedjs/marked/statuses/6b5144c296edfd6a2e499e17df9f6dc4129c91ca", "head": {"label": "sanki92:fix-issue-3776-backtick-precedence", "ref": "fix-issue-3776-backtick-precedence", "sha": "6b5144c296edfd6a2e499e17df9f6dc4129c91ca", "user": {"login": "sanki92", "id": 70330866, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjcwMzMwODY2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70330866?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/sanki92", "html_url": "https://github.com/sanki92", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sanki92/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sanki92/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sanki92/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sanki92/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sanki92/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sanki92/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sanki92/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sanki92/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sanki92/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "repo": {"id": 1069028778, "node_id": "R_kgDOP7gVqg", "name": "marked", "full_name": "sanki92/marked", "private": false, "owner": {"login": "sanki92", "id": 70330866, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjcwMzMwODY2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70330866?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/sanki92", "html_url": "https://github.com/sanki92", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sanki92/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sanki92/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sanki92/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sanki92/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sanki92/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sanki92/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sanki92/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sanki92/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sanki92/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "html_url": "https://github.com/sanki92/marked", "description": "A markdown parser and compiler.

Exclude backticks from the generic char class.\r\n  - Explicitly match inline code spans within brackets.\r\n  - Simplify escape handling with `\\\\.`.\r\n\r\nNew `blockSkip`:\r\n```\r\n\\[(?:[^\\[\\]\\\\`]|\\\\.|`[^`]*`)*?\\]\\((?:\\\\.|[^\\\\\\(\\)]|\\((?:\\\\.|[^\\\\\\(\\)])*\\))*\\)|`[^`]*?`|<(?!)[^<>]*?>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Contributor\r\n- [x] Tests: existing suite passes (1705 tests), including:\r\n  - `angle_brackets` (ensures `<` and `>` don\u2019t break emphasis)\r\n  - `link_tick_redos` (guards against ReDOS)\r\n\r\n## Committer\r\n\r\nIn most cases, this should be a different person than the contributor.\r\n\r\n- [ ] CI is green (no forced merge required).\r\n- [ ] Squash and Merge PR following [conventional commit guidelines](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).\r\n", "created_at": "2025-10-03T11:04:08Z", "updated_at": "2025-10-16T01:24:00Z", "closed_at": "2025-10-16T01:24:00Z", "merged_at": null, "merge_commit_sha": "d3bcb2d3fc213d33270eeb59b2f7c266ee3c470d", "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "requested_reviewers": [{"login": "calculuschild", "id": 5878534, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU4Nzg1MzQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5878534?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/calculuschild", "html_url": "https://github.com/calculuschild", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/calculuschild/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/calculuschild/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/calculuschild/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/calculuschild/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/calculuschild/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/calculuschild/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/calculuschild/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/calculuschild/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/calculuschild/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [], "milestone": null, "draft": false, "commits_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/markedjs/marked/pulls/3779/commits", "review_comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/markedjs/marked/pulls/3779/comments", "review_comment_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/markedjs/marked/pulls/comments{/number}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/markedjs/marked/issues/3779/comments", "statuses_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/markedjs/marked/statuses/45049046b61e004c12fed31ede7960ba18d21c18", "head": {"label": "sajdakabir:fix-blockskip-backtick-issue-3777", "ref": "fix-blockskip-backtick-issue-3777", "sha": "45049046b61e004c12fed31ede7960ba18d21c18", "user": {"login": "sajdakabir", "id": 86569763, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTY5NzYz", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86569763?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/sajdakabir", "html_url": "https://github.com/sajdakabir", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sajdakabir/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sajdakabir/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sajdakabir/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sajdakabir/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sajdakabir/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sajdakabir/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sajdakabir/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sajdakabir/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sajdakabir/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "repo": {"id": 1069039591, "node_id": "R_kgDOP7g_5w", "name": "marked", "full_name": "sajdakabir/marked", "private": false, "owner": {"login": "sajdakabir", "id": 86569763, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTY5NzYz", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86569763?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/sajdakabir", "html_url": "https://github.com/sajdakabir", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sajdakabir/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sajdakabir/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sajdakabir/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sajdakabir/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sajdakabir/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sajdakabir/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sajdakabir/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sajdakabir/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sajdakabir/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "html_url": "https://github.com/sajdakabir/marked", "description": "A markdown parser and compiler.

Variants like `Www.example.com` or `WWW.example.com` should be treated as plain text, not converted to links.\r\n\r\nCase insensitive `http` or `ftp` like `HtTp\"//` that is in text e.g. `test HTTP://example.com` should be autolinked\r\n\r\n## Result\r\n\r\nPreviously, the URL regex pattern used the `i` flag (case-insensitive), causing `www.`, `Www.`, `WWW.`, and other case variations to be detected as autolink starts. This was inconsistent with how GitHub handles autolinks.\r\n\r\n## What was attempted\r\n\r\nModified the `inlineGfm.url` regex in `src/rules.ts` to:\r\n- Remove the case-insensitive flag (`'i'`)\r\n- Make protocol detection case-insensitive by replacing the protocol pattern with `[fF][tT][pP]|[hH][tT][tT][pP][sS]?`\r\n- Keep `www.` case-sensitive (lowercase only)\r\n\r\nAdded test cases to verify:\r\n- `www.example.com` - converted to link\r\n- `Www.example.com` - plain text \r\n- `WWW.example.com` - plain text\r\n\r\n## Contributor\r\n\r\n- [x] Test(s) exist to ensure functionality and minimize regression (added tests in `test/specs/new/autolinks.md` and `test/specs/new/autolinks.html`)\r\n- [x] No new feature documentation required (bug fix only)\r\n\r\n## Committer\r\n\r\nIn most cases, this should be a different person than the contributor.\r\n\r\n- [ ] CI is green (no forced merge required).\r\n- [ ] Squash and Merge PR following [conventional commit guidelines](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).\r\n", "created_at": "2025-09-29T17:39:31Z", "updated_at": "2025-10-07T03:21:11Z", "closed_at": "2025-10-07T03:21:10Z", "merged_at":
