The component now properly uses the `useTranslation` hook and the `general:select` translation key.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nThe `SelectMany` component had its translation functionality commented out, causing it to display hardcoded English text (\"Select X\") instead of being localized for different languages. This broke internationalization support for users viewing the admin panel in non-English locales.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nUncommented the `useTranslation` import and hook usage, then updated the button text to use the `t('general:select')` translation key followed by the count. \r\n\r\nFixes #14816 \r\n\r\n", "created_at": "2025-12-04T20:36:53Z", "updated_at": "2025-12-04T21:16:01Z", "closed_at":

type and updated the preset collection config to include the field. \r\n\r\nModified `QueryPresetBar` to handle groupBy when selecting, deselecting, resetting, saving, or creating presets. \r\n\r\nCreated custom Field and Cell components to display groupBy values in the admin UI. \r\n\r\n#### Preset creation with group-by added\r\n<img width=\"711\" height=\"684\" alt=\"Screenshot

For exact details, please read the summary and impact statements directly from the CVEs listed above. \r\n\r\nWhile this is **not a Payload vulnerability,** it may affect any Payload project running on the affected versions of React or Next.js. Payload does not install any of these dependencies directly, it simply _enforces_ their versions through its peer dependencies, which will only _warn_ you of the version incompatibilities.\r\n\r\nYou will need to upgrade React and Next.js yourself in your own apps to the patched versions listed below in order to receive these updates.\r\n\r\n## Resolution\r\n\r\n**You are strongly encouraged to upgrade your own apps immediately to the nearest patched versions of React and Next.js.** \r\n\r\nQuick steps:\r\n\r\nIf using `pnpm` as your package manager, here's a one-liner:\r\n\r\n```\r\npnpm add react@19.2.1 next@15.4.8\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo do this manually:\r\n\r\n1. In your `package.json`:\r\n    - Bump `react` to `19.2.1`\r\n    - Bump `next` to `15.4.8`\r\n2. Reinstall node modules, e.g. `pnpm i`\r\n3. Redeploy your app\r\n\r\nHere's a full breakdown of the vulnerable packages and their patched releases:\r\n\r\n| Vulnerable package | Patched release |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| React | 19.0, 19.1, 19.2\t19.0.1, 19.1.2, and 19.2.1 |\r\n| Next.js | 14.3.0-canary, 15.x, and 16.x (App Router)\t14.3.0-canary.88, 15.0.5, 15.1.9, 15.2.6, 15.3.6, 15.4.8, 15.5.7, 16.0.7 |", "created_at": "2025-12-03T18:14:23Z", "updated_at": "2025-12-03T22:38:19Z", "closed_at": "2025-12-03T19:28:40Z", "merged_at": "2025-12-03T19:28:40Z", "merge_commit_sha": "2dfe4643d43783ffd619ef4c389290a9f91a62fb", "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [{"id": 6982035597, "node_id": "LA_kwDOE37-zs8AAAABoClojQ", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payloadcms/payload/labels/created-by:%20Payload%20team", "name": "created-by: Payload team", "color": "000000", "default": false, "description": ""}], "milestone": null, "draft": false, "commits_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payloadcms/payload/pulls/14807/commits", "review_comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payloadcms/payload/pulls/14807/comments", "review_comment_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payloadcms/payload/pulls/comments{/number}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payloadcms/payload/issues/14807/comments", "statuses_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payloadcms/payload/statuses/3247df44f8918371a4907c0bf8f2ada8bf3e2afd", "head": {"label": "payloadcms:deps/bump-react-next", "ref": "deps/bump-react-next", "sha": "3247df44f8918371a4907c0bf8f2ada8bf3e2afd", "user": {"login": "payloadcms", "id": 62968818, "node_id": "MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYyOTY4ODE4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62968818?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms", "html_url": "https://github.com/payloadcms", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/received_events", "type": "Organization", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "repo": {"id": 327089870, "node_id": "MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjcwODk4NzA=", "name": "payload", "full_name": "payloadcms/payload", "private": false, "owner": {"login": "payloadcms", "id": 62968818, "node_id": "MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYyOTY4ODE4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62968818?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms", "html_url": "https://github.com/payloadcms", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/received_events", "type": "Organization", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "html_url": "https://github.com/payloadcms/payload", "description": "Payload is the open-source, fullstack Next.js framework, giving you instant backend superpowers.

This caused the page parameter to become `NaN` (`undefined + 1 = NaN`), breaking pagination for subsequent collection types.\r\n\r\n### How\r\n\r\nAdded a fallback to default to `0` when the relation hasn't been paginated yet:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nlastLoadedPageToUse = (lastLoadedPageArg[relation] || 0) + 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nFixes #14754 ", "created_at": "2025-12-02T19:10:32Z", "updated_at":

This created a type mismatch that only worked by accident at runtime.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\n- Removed `user` and `userCollection` from base `Export` type\r\n- Created `ExportJobInput` type that extends `Export` with serialization fields\r\n- Updated `CreateExportArgs` to accept `user?: TypedUser | null` as separate parameter\r\n- Fixed all call sites to pass user separately instead of in input object\r\n- Added validation to ensure user exists before creating exports\r\n- Job queue handler now strips serialization fields before passing to `createExport`\r\n", "created_at": "2025-12-02T15:21:22Z", "updated_at": "2025-12-03T21:20:16Z", "closed_at": "2025-12-02T18:11:51Z", "merged_at": "2025-12-02T18:11:51Z", "merge_commit_sha": "61f5aeed7e2054aba18294fe67f82d998044c581", "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [{"id": 6982035597, "node_id": "LA_kwDOE37-zs8AAAABoClojQ", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payloadcms/payload/labels/created-by:%20Payload%20team", "name": "created-by: Payload team", "color": "000000", "default": false, "description": ""}], "milestone": null, "draft": false, "commits_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payloadcms/payload/pulls/14790/commits", "review_comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payloadcms/payload/pulls/14790/comments", "review_comment_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payloadcms/payload/pulls/comments{/number}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payloadcms/payload/issues/14790/comments", "statuses_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payloadcms/payload/statuses/8039b4db9c19051c7b8ac919179dec6065262f30", "head": {"label": "payloadcms:fix/plugin-import-export-user-type-consistency", "ref": "fix/plugin-import-export-user-type-consistency", "sha": "8039b4db9c19051c7b8ac919179dec6065262f30", "user": {"login": "payloadcms", "id": 62968818, "node_id": "MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYyOTY4ODE4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62968818?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms", "html_url": "https://github.com/payloadcms", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/received_events", "type": "Organization", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "repo": {"id": 327089870, "node_id": "MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjcwODk4NzA=", "name": "payload", "full_name": "payloadcms/payload", "private": false, "owner": {"login": "payloadcms", "id": 62968818, "node_id": "MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYyOTY4ODE4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62968818?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms", "html_url": "https://github.com/payloadcms", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/received_events", "type": "Organization", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "html_url": "https://github.com/payloadcms/payload", "description": "Payload is the open-source, fullstack Next.js framework, giving you instant backend superpowers.

The table has `min-width: 100%` which forces it to fill the container width, and all columns have the same `min-width: 150px`, causing them to distribute the available space evenly. This created an awkward gap between the checkbox and the first data column.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nSets the checkbox and drag handle column widths to `var(--base)` (20px) to match their actual content size. This is a CSS-only solution that keeps these columns compact regardless of how many columns are displayed, reducing the spacing to the first data column.\r\n\r\n#### Before\r\n<img width=\"1410\"

This leads to type errors or the need for type assertions when trying to use them. Aligning the type definition with the existing runtime behavior improves DX and keeps the admin field types consistent, similar to what was done for RichTextField in #12889.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nExtended the UploadAdmin type to include the `beforeInput` and `afterInput` properties.", "created_at": "2025-12-01T14:59:24Z", "updated_at": "2025-12-04T17:19:09Z", "closed_at": "2025-12-04T17:19:09Z", "merged_at": "2025-12-04T17:19:09Z", "merge_commit_sha": "22a02557d650e3ecaf4ec7cbc288f6d971205bc5", "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [{"id": 6984574128, "node_id": "LA_kwDOE37-zs8AAAABoFAksA", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payloadcms/payload/labels/created-by:%20Contributor", "name": "created-by: Contributor", "color": "0052CC", "default": false, "description": ""}], "milestone": null, "draft": false, "commits_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payloadcms/payload/pulls/14775/commits", "review_comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payloadcms/payload/pulls/14775/comments", "review_comment_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payloadcms/payload/pulls/comments{/number}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payloadcms/payload/issues/14775/comments", "statuses_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payloadcms/payload/statuses/fe0cd1e90aee961d8547ceffe09146d5bba150da", "head": {"label": "jhb-dev:fix/upload-admin-before-after-input-type", "ref": "fix/upload-admin-before-after-input-type", "sha": "fe0cd1e90aee961d8547ceffe09146d5bba150da", "user": {"login": "jhb-dev", "id": 20878653, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIwODc4NjUz", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20878653?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jhb-dev", "html_url": "https://github.com/jhb-dev", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jhb-dev/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jhb-dev/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jhb-dev/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jhb-dev/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jhb-dev/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jhb-dev/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jhb-dev/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jhb-dev/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jhb-dev/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "repo": {"id": 755289813, "node_id": "R_kgDOLQTO1Q", "name": "payload", "full_name": "jhb-dev/payload", "private": false, "owner": {"login": "jhb-dev", "id": 20878653, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIwODc4NjUz", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20878653?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jhb-dev", "html_url": "https://github.com/jhb-dev", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jhb-dev/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jhb-dev/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jhb-dev/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jhb-dev/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jhb-dev/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jhb-dev/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jhb-dev/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jhb-dev/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jhb-dev/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "html_url": "https://github.com/jhb-dev/payload", "description": "The best way to build a modern backend + admin UI.

`ClipboardEvent`.\r\n\r\nI resolved this with a conditional block for the case where the selection is of type `NodeSelection`.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nI added tests for the RangeSelection case as well

Collections and globals were still using `Record<string, any>` directly, so there was no way to get proper types when building plugins that need collection/global-level configuration.\r\n\r\nThis made it annoying to build well-typed plugins since you'd lose all type safety and autocomplete at the collection/global level.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\n- Added the four interfaces (same pattern as `FieldCustom` - empty interfaces extending `Record<string, any>`)\r\n- Updated the type definitions in `collections/config/types.ts` and `globals/config/types.ts` to use them\r\n- Updated `plugin-import-export` to augment `CollectionAdminCustom` so it gets proper types for the `disabledFields` array it stores\r\n\r\nFixes #14724 \r\n\r\n", "created_at": "2025-11-25T16:35:25Z", "updated_at": "2025-11-25T18:47:38Z", "closed_at": "2025-11-25T17:38:37Z", "merged_at": "2025-11-25T17:38:37Z", "merge_commit_sha": "850c25291bc7235f848761f10d623a32523afe7f", "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [{"id": 6982035597, "node_id": "LA_kwDOE37-zs8AAAABoClojQ", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payloadcms/payload/labels/created-by:%20Payload%20team", "name": "created-by: Payload team", "color": "000000", "default": false, "description": ""}], "milestone": null, "draft": false, "commits_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payloadcms/payload/pulls/14729/commits", "review_comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payloadcms/payload/pulls/14729/comments", "review_comment_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payloadcms/payload/pulls/comments{/number}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payloadcms/payload/issues/14729/comments", "statuses_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payloadcms/payload/statuses/3cf6ecb3db3805495d50a84c19507169a4001ee4", "head": {"label": "payloadcms:feat/augmentable-custom-interfaces", "ref": "feat/augmentable-custom-interfaces", "sha": "3cf6ecb3db3805495d50a84c19507169a4001ee4", "user": {"login": "payloadcms", "id": 62968818, "node_id": "MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYyOTY4ODE4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62968818?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms", "html_url": "https://github.com/payloadcms", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/received_events", "type": "Organization", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "repo": {"id": 327089870, "node_id": "MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjcwODk4NzA=", "name": "payload", "full_name": "payloadcms/payload", "private": false, "owner": {"login": "payloadcms", "id": 62968818, "node_id": "MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYyOTY4ODE4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62968818?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms", "html_url": "https://github.com/payloadcms", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/received_events", "type": "Organization", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "html_url": "https://github.com/payloadcms/payload", "description": "Payload is the open-source, fullstack Next.js framework, giving you instant backend superpowers.

When the UI tries to render or sanitize these presets, it calls `Object.keys()` on null values and crashes with `TypeError: Cannot convert undefined or null to object`.\r\n\r\nThis only happens in Postgres/SQLite because MongoDB doesn't store missing fields at all - they just come back as `undefined`. SQL databases explicitly store `NULL` values.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nAdded null checks before calling `Object.keys()` in three places:\r\n- `sanitizeQuery.ts` - The main fix that prevents the crash when loading presets\r\n- `WhereField` component - Defensive check when rendering the where field\r\n- `WhereCell` component - Defensive check when rendering the where cell in tables\r\n\r\nFixes

For example, `feat: my new feature`, `fix(plugin-seo): my fix`.\r\n- Minimal description explained as if explained to someone not immediately familiar with the code.\r\n- Provide before/after screenshots or code diffs if applicable.\r\n- Link any related issues/discussions from GitHub or Discord.\r\n- Add review comments if necessary to explain to the reviewer the logic behind a change\r\n\r\n### What?\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nFixes #\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What?\r\nAdded execution of `beforeLogin` and `afterLogin` hooks during the password reset operation in `resetPasswordOperation()`. These hooks now execute with the same parameters and flow as they do in the standard login operation, ensuring consistent behavior across both authentication paths.\r\n- `packages/payload/src/auth/operations/resetPassword.ts` - Added hook execution before and after JWT token generation.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n When a user resets their password, the operation performs two phases: updating the password in the database, then automatically logging the user in with a new session and JWT token. However, `beforeLogin` and `afterLogin` hooks were not being triggered during this auto-login phase, creating inconsistent behavior compared to standard login.\r\nThis caused issues for applications that uses `afterLogin` hooks to attach additional cookie (for example).\r\n\r\n### How?\r\nTriggered `beforeLogin` and `afterLogin` in `resetPassword.ts`\r\n", "created_at": "2025-11-21T23:53:06Z", "updated_at": "2025-11-25T18:47:22Z", "closed_at": "2025-11-25T16:29:14Z", "merged_at": "2025-11-25T16:29:14Z", "merge_commit_sha": "32560e91993a9a875f2250b99adab08abc08cfbe", "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [], "milestone": null, "draft": false, "commits_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payloadcms/payload/pulls/14711/commits", "review_comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payloadcms/payload/pulls/14711/comments", "review_comment_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payloadcms/payload/pulls/comments{/number}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payloadcms/payload/issues/14711/comments", "statuses_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payloadcms/payload/statuses/f0a8080581a5a3ecec2a9639c3e2e3e36e5d0c73", "head": {"label": "MrLijan:fix/TriggerLoginHooksAfterResetPassword", "ref": "fix/TriggerLoginHooksAfterResetPassword", "sha": "f0a8080581a5a3ecec2a9639c3e2e3e36e5d0c73", "user": {"login": "MrLijan", "id": 50079872, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwMDc5ODcy", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50079872?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrLijan", "html_url": "https://github.com/MrLijan", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrLijan/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrLijan/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrLijan/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrLijan/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrLijan/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrLijan/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrLijan/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrLijan/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrLijan/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "repo": {"id": 910279949, "node_id": "R_kgDONkHFDQ", "name": "payload-forked", "full_name": "MrLijan/payload-forked", "private": false, "owner": {"login": "MrLijan", "id": 50079872, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwMDc5ODcy", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50079872?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrLijan", "html_url": "https://github.com/MrLijan", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrLijan/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrLijan/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrLijan/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrLijan/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrLijan/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrLijan/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrLijan/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrLijan/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrLijan/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "html_url": "https://github.com/MrLijan/payload-forked", "description": "Payload is the open-source, fullstack Next.js framework, giving you instant backend superpowers.

For example, `feat: my new feature`, `fix(plugin-seo): my fix`.\r\n- Minimal description explained as if explained to someone not immediately familiar with the code.\r\n- Provide before/after screenshots or code diffs if applicable.\r\n- Link any related issues/discussions from GitHub or Discord.\r\n- Add review comments if necessary to explain to the reviewer the logic behind a change\r\n\r\nFixes #\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What?\r\nAdded execution of beforeLogin and afterLogin hooks during the password reset operation in resetPasswordOperation(). These hooks now execute with the same parameters and flow as they do in the standard login operation, ensuring consistent behavior across both authentication paths.\r\n- `packages/payload/src/auth/operations/resetPassword.ts` - Added hook execution before and after JWT token generation.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n When a user resets their password, the operation performs two phases: updating the password in the database, then automatically logging the user in with a new session and JWT token. However, `beforeLogin` and `afterLogin` hooks were not being triggered during this auto-login phase, creating inconsistent behavior compared to standard login.\r\nThis caused issues for applications that uses `afterLogin` hooks to attach additional cookie (for example).\r\n\r\n### How?\r\nTriggered `beforeLogin` and `afterLogin` in `resetPassword.ts`", "created_at": "2025-11-21T22:09:49Z", "updated_at": "2025-11-21T23:45:42Z", "closed_at": "2025-11-21T23:44:56Z", "merged_at": null, "merge_commit_sha": "52186685fd1de0938b22d212ca0f480b73645d37", "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [], "milestone": null, "draft": false, "commits_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payloadcms/payload/pulls/14706/commits", "review_comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payloadcms/payload/pulls/14706/comments", "review_comment_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payloadcms/payload/pulls/comments{/number}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payloadcms/payload/issues/14706/comments", "statuses_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payloadcms/payload/statuses/f0a8080581a5a3ecec2a9639c3e2e3e36e5d0c73", "head": {"label": "MrLijan:fix(auth-hooks)/TriggerLoginHooksAfterResetPassword", "ref": "fix(auth-hooks)/TriggerLoginHooksAfterResetPassword", "sha": "f0a8080581a5a3ecec2a9639c3e2e3e36e5d0c73", "user": {"login": "MrLijan", "id": 50079872, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwMDc5ODcy", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50079872?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrLijan", "html_url": "https://github.com/MrLijan", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrLijan/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrLijan/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrLijan/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrLijan/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrLijan/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrLijan/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrLijan/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrLijan/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrLijan/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "repo": {"id": 910279949, "node_id": "R_kgDONkHFDQ", "name": "payload-forked", "full_name": "MrLijan/payload-forked", "private": false, "owner": {"login": "MrLijan", "id": 50079872, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwMDc5ODcy", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50079872?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrLijan", "html_url": "https://github.com/MrLijan", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrLijan/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrLijan/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrLijan/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrLijan/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrLijan/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrLijan/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrLijan/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrLijan/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrLijan/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "html_url": "https://github.com/MrLijan/payload-forked", "description": "Payload is the open-source, fullstack Next.js framework, giving you instant backend superpowers.

We need to externalize these packages.\r\n\r\n**Why we can't externalize them directly:**\r\n\r\nWith pnpm, externalizing a package like `drizzle-kit` generates `require('drizzle-kit')` calls in the bundle. However, `drizzle-kit` is not in the user's `package.json` (it's a transitive dependency installed by `db-postgres`). pnpm's strict dependency isolation prevents importing dependencies of dependencies, causing runtime failures.\r\n\r\n**The attempted workaround:**\r\n\r\nInstead of externalizing `drizzle-kit`, we tried externalizing the entry-point package `@payloadcms/db-postgres` (which users DO install) via `serverExternalPackages`. This works in development, but creates severe issues in production builds.\r\n\r\n## Why the Workaround Failed\r\n\r\nWhen you externalize `@payloadcms/db-postgres`:\r\n\r\n1. **Everything it imports becomes external**, including `payload` itself\r\n2. This creates **two copies of `payload`**:\r\n   - One bundled (from user's direct imports)\r\n   - One external in node_modules (from db-postgres's imports)\r\n3. **Bundle size explodes** due to:\r\n   - Disabled tree-shaking for externalized packages\r\n   - Duplicate package installations\r\n   - Loss of code-splitting optimizations\r\n\r\n**Another example of duplication:**\r\n```\r\n@payloadcms/richtext-lexical (bundled) \u2192 qs-esm (bundled)\r\npayload (external) \u2192 qs-esm (external)\r\nResult: Two copies of qs-esm in production\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis issue was reported on our discord [here](https://discord.com/channels/967097582721572934/1422639568808841329/1440689060015374437).\r\n\r\n## The Solution (This PR)\r\n\r\n**Short term:** Disable Turbopack build support until Next.js provides a proper solution.\r\n\r\n### Why Webpack Works\r\n\r\nWebpack has `webpack.externals`, which can externalize **any** package regardless of whether it's in the user's `package.json`:\r\n\r\n- We externalize `drizzle-kit` directly via `webpack.externals`\r\n- Webpack generates `require('drizzle-kit')` calls in the bundle\r\n- At runtime, Node.js resolves these just fine - we're not yet sure why that is\r\n- We avoid externalizing entry-point packages, preventing the duplication problem\r\n\r\n### Why Turbopack Build Doesn't Work\r\n\r\nTurbopack only has `serverExternalPackages` (similar to webpack.externals but with restrictions):\r\n\r\n- **The constraint**: Packages must be resolvable from the project root (i.e., in the user's `package.json`)\r\n- If a package isn't directly installed by the user, Next.js **ignores the externalization rule** and tries to bundle it anyway\r\n- This forces us to externalize entry-point packages (`db-postgres`), which causes the duplication and bundle size problems described above\r\n\r\n### Why Turbopack Dev Works\r\n\r\nTurbopack dev has the same `serverExternalPackages` constraint, BUT:\r\n\r\n- **In dev, we can afford the trade-off** of externalizing entry-point packages because:\r\n  - Bundle size doesn't matter in development\r\n  - Faster compilation speed is more important\r\n  - We're not shipping to production\r\n- The duplication problem still exists, but it's acceptable for the dev experience\r\n\r\n**Changes made in comparison to our old withPayload config:**\r\n\r\n1. **Throw error for Turbopack builds** - Prevent production builds with Turbopack until Next.js fixes the underlying issue\r\n2. **Simplify serverExternalPackages** - Only externalize packages resolvable from project root (`graphql`, `@sentry/nextjs`)\r\n3. **Clean up unnecessary config** - Remove webpack configurations that are no longer justifiable. Any configuration we have left now comes with a comment block explaining why we need it\r\n4. **enable devBundleServerPackages optimization by default** - there have not been any reported issues since this was introduced, and this setting is now **necessary** for turbopack support during dev\r\n\r\n## Future\r\n\r\nIn order to properly support Turbopack Build, Next.js will have to implement one of these solutions:\r\n\r\n- **Option 1**: Implement webpack.externals-like functionality for Turbopack (no package.json constraint)\r\n- **Option 2**: Remove the need for declaring all externals as direct dependencies in the application\r\n\r\nWe're tracking Next.js's progress on this issue.", "created_at": "2025-11-20T20:25:12Z", "updated_at": "2025-11-25T18:47:24Z", "closed_at": "2025-11-20T21:22:18Z", "merged_at": "2025-11-20T21:22:18Z", "merge_commit_sha": "c484a05528e7319e590e73217cea045552c9da38", "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [{"id": 6982035597, "node_id": "LA_kwDOE37-zs8AAAABoClojQ", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payloadcms/payload/labels/created-by:%20Payload%20team", "name": "created-by: Payload team", "color": "000000", "default": false, "description": ""}], "milestone": null, "draft": false, "commits_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payloadcms/payload/pulls/14696/commits", "review_comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payloadcms/payload/pulls/14696/comments", "review_comment_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payloadcms/payload/pulls/comments{/number}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payloadcms/payload/issues/14696/comments", "statuses_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payloadcms/payload/statuses/ef335bd44583f3238769d5f96f35d6e2c1c555db", "head": {"label": "payloadcms:fix/withpayload-issues", "ref": "fix/withpayload-issues", "sha": "ef335bd44583f3238769d5f96f35d6e2c1c555db", "user": {"login": "payloadcms", "id": 62968818, "node_id": "MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYyOTY4ODE4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62968818?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms", "html_url": "https://github.com/payloadcms", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/received_events", "type": "Organization", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "repo": {"id": 327089870, "node_id": "MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjcwODk4NzA=", "name": "payload", "full_name": "payloadcms/payload", "private": false, "owner": {"login": "payloadcms", "id": 62968818, "node_id": "MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYyOTY4ODE4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62968818?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms", "html_url": "https://github.com/payloadcms", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/payloadcms/received_events", "type": "Organization", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "html_url": "https://github.com/payloadcms/payload", "description": "Payload is the open-source, fullstack Next.js framework, giving you instant backend superpowers.

add support for Turbopack build:\n- https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/pull/14475\n- https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/pull/14473\n\n## The Fundamental Problem\n\nPayload's database adapters (e.g., `@payloadcms/db-postgres`) depend on\npackages with native dependencies that cannot be bundled (e.g.,\n`drizzle-kit`, which imports `esbuild`). We need to externalize these\npackages.\n\n**Why we can't externalize them directly:**\n\nWith pnpm, externalizing a package like `drizzle-kit` generates\n`require('drizzle-kit')` calls in the bundle. However, `drizzle-kit` is\nnot in the user's `package.json` (it's a transitive dependency installed\nby `db-postgres`). pnpm's strict dependency isolation prevents importing\ndependencies of dependencies, causing runtime failures.\n\n**The attempted workaround:**\n\nInstead of externalizing `drizzle-kit`, we tried externalizing the\nentry-point package `@payloadcms/db-postgres` (which users DO install)\nvia `serverExternalPackages`. This works in development, but creates\nsevere issues in production builds.\n\n## Why the Workaround Failed\n\nWhen you externalize `@payloadcms/db-postgres`:\n\n1. **Everything it imports becomes external**, including `payload`\nitself\n2. This creates **two copies of `payload`**:\n   - One bundled (from user's direct imports)\n   - One external in node_modules (from db-postgres's imports)\n3. **Bundle size explodes** due to:\n   - Disabled tree-shaking for externalized packages\n   - Duplicate package installations\n   - Loss of code-splitting optimizations\n\n**Another example of duplication:**\n```\n@payloadcms/richtext-lexical (bundled) \u2192 qs-esm (bundled)\npayload (external) \u2192 qs-esm (external)\nResult: Two copies of qs-esm in production\n```\n\nThis issue was reported on our discord\n[here](https://discord.com/channels/967097582721572934/1422639568808841329/1440689060015374437).\n\n## The Solution (This PR)\n\n**Short term:** Disable Turbopack build support until Next.js provides a\nproper solution.\n\n### Why Webpack Works\n\nWebpack has `webpack.externals`, which can externalize **any** package\nregardless of whether it's in the user's `package.json`:\n\n- We externalize `drizzle-kit` directly via `webpack.externals`\n- Webpack generates `require('drizzle-kit')` calls in the bundle\n- At runtime, Node.js resolves these just fine - we're not yet sure why\nthat is\n- We avoid externalizing entry-point packages, preventing the\nduplication problem\n\n### Why Turbopack Build Doesn't Work\n\nTurbopack only has `serverExternalPackages` (similar to\nwebpack.externals but with restrictions):\n\n- **The constraint**: Packages must be resolvable from the project root\n(i.e., in the user's `package.json`)\n- If a package isn't directly installed by the user, Next.js **ignores\nthe externalization rule** and tries to bundle it anyway\n- This forces us to externalize entry-point packages (`db-postgres`),\nwhich causes the duplication and bundle size problems described above\n\n### Why Turbopack Dev Works\n\nTurbopack dev has the same `serverExternalPackages` constraint, BUT:\n\n- **In dev, we can afford the trade-off** of externalizing entry-point\npackages because:\n  - Bundle size doesn't matter in development\n  - Faster compilation speed is more important\n  - We're not shipping to production\n- The duplication problem still exists, but it's acceptable for the dev\nexperience\n\n**Changes made:**\n\n1. **Throw error for Turbopack builds** - Prevent production builds with\nTurbopack until Next.js fixes the underlying issue\n2. **Restore webpack.externals** - Use webpack-specific externals for\nproblematic transitive dependencies (`drizzle-kit`, `sharp`, `libsql`,\netc.) that aren't in user's package.json\n3. **Simplify serverExternalPackages** - Only externalize packages\nresolvable from project root (`graphql`, `@sentry/nextjs`)\n4. **Clean up unnecessary config** - Remove webpack configurations that\nare no longer justifiable. Any configuration we have left now comes with\na comment block explaining why we need it\n5. **enable devBundleServerPackages optimization by default** - there\nhave not been any reported issues since this was introduced, and this\nsetting is now **necessary** for turbopack support during dev\n\n## Future\n\nIn order to properly support Turbopack Build, Next.js will have to\nimplement one of these solutions:\n\n- **Option 1**: Implement webpack.externals-like functionality for\nTurbopack (no package.json constraint)\n- **Option 2**: Remove the need for declaring all externals as direct\ndependencies in the application\n\nWe're tracking Next.js's progress on this issue."}, "active_lock_reason": null, "resolved_issues": []}

The collection/global has localized fields\r\n2. `localization.defaultLocalePublishOption` is set to `'active'`\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nPR #13459 fixed the submenu \"Publish in [specific locale]\" button to not appear on collections without localized fields, but missed updating the main button label logic.\r\n\r\nThis caused the main publish button to display \"Publish in [locale]\" even when a collection had no localized fields (when `defaultLocalePublishOption: 'active'` was set).\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\n- Updated `publishAll` calculation to check `canPublishSpecificLocale` (which includes the `hasLocalizedFields` check) instead of just checking if localization is enabled\r\n- Changed the button label rendering from `{localization ? defaultLabel : label}` to `{canPublishSpecificLocale ? defaultLabel : label}`\r\n\r\nFixes #14386 \r\n", "created_at": "2025-11-20T16:44:56Z", "updated_at": "2025-11-25T18:47:33Z", "closed_at": "2025-11-20T18:44:13Z", "merged_at": "2025-11-20T18:44:13Z",
