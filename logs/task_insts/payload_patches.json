It would be great if translation support could be properly implemented in a future release.\n\nIs it possible to fix this in the next update?\n\n<img width=\"752\" height=\"625\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11ffbd2d-e21e-4fd3-8f99-1a474d81da6f\" />\n\n### Environment Info\n\n```text\nBinaries:\n  Node: 23.5.0\n  npm: 11.3.0\n  Yarn: 1.22.22\n  pnpm: 10.22.0\nRelevant Packages:\n  payload: 3.66.0\n  next: 15.4.8\n  @payloadcms/db-postgres: 3.66.0\n  @payloadcms/drizzle: 3.64.0\n  @payloadcms/graphql: 3.64.0\n  @payloadcms/live-preview: 3.65.0\n  @payloadcms/live-preview-react: 3.66.0\n  @payloadcms/next/utilities: 3.66.0\n  @payloadcms/plugin-form-builder: 3.66.0\n  @payloadcms/plugin-nested-docs: 3.66.0\n  @payloadcms/plugin-redirects: 3.66.0\n  @payloadcms/plugin-search: 3.66.0\n  @payloadcms/plugin-seo: 3.66.0\n  @payloadcms/richtext-lexical: 3.66.0\n  @payloadcms/translations: 3.66.0\n  @payloadcms/ui/shared: 3.66.0\n  react: 19.2.1\n  react-dom: 19.1.0\nOperating System:\n  Platform: linux\n  Arch: x64\n  Version: #173-Ubuntu SMP Tue Oct 14 17:51:00 UTC 2025\n  Available memory (MB): 31930\n  Available CPU cores: 28\n```\n",
